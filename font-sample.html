    <p class="h1">Bichon Frise</p>
    <p class="header">Description</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The small but sturdy and resilient Bichon Frise stands among the world's great 'personality dogs.' Since antiquity, these irresistible canine comedians have relied on charm, beauty, and intelligence to weather history's ups and downs. A good-size Bichon will stand a shade under a foot tall at the shoulder. The breed's glory is a white hypoallergenic coat, plush and velvety to the touch, featuring rounded head hair that sets off the large, dark eyes and black leathers of the nose and lips. Bichons are adaptable companions who get on well with other dogs and children. Alert and curious, Bichons make nice little watchdogs'Â¿but they are lovers, not fighters, and operate under the assumption that there are no strangers, just friends they haven't met yet. Their confidence and size make them ideal city dogs. Bichons train nicely and enjoy performing for their loved ones. Finally, there's the happy-go-lucky Bichon personality that draws smiles and hugs wherever they go.
